Project Update 
Project Demo for Anjaneya, Srinath and Sanal


App.jsx (parent) - state = products
    pass products as a props to child component 
        define a function which update state and we can pass this function as a props to child component
            AddProduct (child) - 
                adding data in localstorage



App.jsx (parent) - state = products
    pass products as a props to child component 
        AddProduct (child) - 
            adding data in localstorage



Scenario 1
App.jsx - products
    <ProductList products={products} />


Users CRUD 
----------
Create - Add Product
Read - Displaying Product List
Update - Edit Product 
Delete - Delete Modal

localstorage separate component - storage.js

Redux 
-----

Step 1
npm i redux react-redux

Step 2
Create redux and data folder inside src folder

redux folder
    reducers.js file - function which update state based on actions
    https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/redux/reducers.js

    actions.js file - 3 actions, removeProduct, addProduct and loadProducts
    https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/redux/actions.js

data folder
    products.js -> move data inside this file
    https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/data/products.js

Step 3
main.jsx -> App.jsx file (current approach)

Create ReduxExample.jsx component
main.jsx -> ReduxExample.jsx -> App.jsx file (revised)

https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/ReduxExample.jsx

- Redux configuration

Step 4
Store setup
Update main.jsx file

main.jsx -> ReduxExample.jsx file

https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/main.jsx
https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/ReduxExample.jsx

Step 5
call action inside component (dispatch action inside component)

App.jsx file
https://github.com/programmingwithharsh/react_nov25/blob/main/src/App.jsx

Step 6
Redux Debugger for debugging purpose - https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en

Angular 
ngRx (Redux)
